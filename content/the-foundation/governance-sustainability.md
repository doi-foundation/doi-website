## Financials

The DOI Foundation operates on an annual budget of around $1 million USD. All revenues come from annual fees paid by the [Registration Agencies]() and members. These fees are set and reviewed annually by the Board.

About 70% of our expenses are used for the running and maintenance of the DOI System infrastructure. 

We maintain a reserve fund to support long-term sustainability. This is managed by the Executive Committee and overseen by the Audit Committee

### Form 990s
Each year, our auditors prepare our Form 990, which the United States' IRS requires and is made publicly available. It gives an overview of what we do, how we operate, and detailed financial information.
