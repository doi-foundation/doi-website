## Our Financials

The DOI Foundation operates on an annual budget of around $1 million USD. All revenues come from annual fees paid by the Registration Agencies and members. These fees are set and reviewed annually by the Board.

About 70% of our expenses are used for the running and maintenance of the DOI System infrastructure. 

We maintain a reserve fund to support long-term sustainability. This is managed by the Executive Committee and overseen by the Audit Committee
