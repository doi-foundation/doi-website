## WARNING: Fake DOI schemes

### March 14, 2024

There are unauthorized entities that mimic the DOI® logo and system and purport to register digital object identifiers. The DOI® Foundation's Registration Agencies are the only entities authorized to issue DOI® identifiers that comply with ISO 26324.  Before opening any link to or providing any information to any organization purporting to register digital object identifiers be sure to confirm that it is an authorized DOI® Registration Agency, as shown [here](/the-community/existing-registration-agencies/).

Fake DOI schemes that we are currently aware of are:

www.doi-ojs.org <br>
www.doie.org <br>
www.doiref.org <br>
doi.one <br>
journalofgeocentriccosmology.org <br>


We would encourage you to please report any suspicious use of DOI / Digital Object Identifier to us at [info@doi.org](mailto:info@doi.org)
