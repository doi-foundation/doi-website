DOI Data Dictionary
----------
 
### Scope

The DOI Data Dictionary contains the names and definitions of all terms used in the **DOI Metadata Kernel** schema, including the Allowed Value Sets used for elements with controlled vocabularies.

### Structure

The Dictionary is organized as a hierarchical ontology, so that each term has one or more "parents" or supertypes, with the term Entity at the top of the hierarchical tree. It is published as a set of web pages which may be navigated by hyperlink. The Dictionary contains other terms not used in messages but necessary to establish the supertype hierarchy.

### Adding Terms

Terms will be added to the Dictionary at the request of any DOI Registration Agency by the modification of the Metadata Kernel and/or its Allowed Values, or the publication of other DOI message schemas in addition to the Metadata Kernel. Any Registration Agency may add new values
