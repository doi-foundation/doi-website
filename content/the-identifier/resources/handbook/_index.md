## DOI速 Handbook

The DOI速 Handbook is the primary source of information about the DOI速 system. The DOI name 10.1000/182 identifies the currently applicable latest version of the handbook. This version was written to reflect the approval and publication of ISO 26324: DOI System, in 2012, and includes relevant ISO terminology.

Compliance with this and subsequent versions of the DOI Handbook will ensure compliance with the ISO 26324 standard. Individual chapters of the handbook will be updated separately; the date of the last update for each chapter is shown in each chapter's heading. Note that some links in the handbook are to additional material available only to members of the International DOI Foundation.
