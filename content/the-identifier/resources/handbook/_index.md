## DOI® Handbook

The DOI Handbook is the main source of information about the DOI System (DOI https://doi.org/10.1000/182 identifies the latest current version of the handbook). It describes the DOI System at business and technical levels and assists the community in understanding the system and Registration Agencies (RA) in providing services based on the system.

The DOI Handbook is available in HTML <link to microsite> and PDF <link to file> formats.

Please [contact us](mailto:info@doi.org) if you have any questions or comments on the DOI Handbook

Note that the DOI Handbook is currently under active review and will be updated to reflect the revised ISO 26324:2022 Standard which is under development (ISO/DIS 26324) and expected to replace 26324:2022 within the coming months.
