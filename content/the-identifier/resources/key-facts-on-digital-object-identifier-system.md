## Key Facts on Digital Object Identifier System

[< back to the Resources page](../)

### Key concepts and abbreviations

*   DOI = Digital Object Identifier
*   IDF = International DOI Foundation (operating and governing organisation): [https://www.doi.org/](https://www.doi.org/)
*   RAs = DOI Registration Agencies (= members of IDF offering the system to customers who wish to assign DOI names)

### Status: operational system

*   Foundation launched to develop system in 1998. First applications launched 2000
*   Currently used by well over 5,000 assigners, e.g., publishers, science data centres, movie studios, etc.
*   Approximately 275 million DOI names assigned to date
*   Over 155,000 DOI name prefixes within the DOI System
*   Approximately 1 billion DOI resolutions per month
*   DOI names are assigned by [multiple RAs](/the-community/existing-registration-agencies/) worldwide
*   Over 30 million [shortDOI](http://www.shortdoi.org) links to DOI names are in use
*   Initial applications are simple redirection — a persistent identifier
*   More sophisticated functionality available, e.g., multiple resolution, data typing
*   International Standard: ISO 26324, Digital Object Identifier System, 1 May 2012 (available from the [ISO Store](http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm))

### Scope

*   _Digital Identifier_ of an _Object_ (not "Identifier of a Digital Object")
*   Object = any entity (thing: physical, digital, or abstract)
	*   Resources, parties, licences, etc.
*   Digital Identifier = network actionable identifier ("click on it and do something")
*   Generic framework
*   Initial focus on entities was documents/media e.g., articles, data sets
	*   Now also moving into parties and licences
	*   Extending to other sectors
*   Extensible by design to any sector: not intended as a publishing-only solution (digital convergence)
*   International coverage

### What it does

*   Provides an _actionable, interoperable, persistent_ link
*   _Actionable_ – through use of identifier syntax and network resolution mechanism (Handle System®)
*   _Persistent_ – through combination of supporting improved handle infrastructure (registry database, proxy support, etc) and social infrastructure (obligations by Registration Agencies)
*   _Interoperable_ – through use of a data model providing semantic interoperability and grouping mechanisms

### Governance

*   IDF = operating and governing organisation
*   Provides the social infrastructure
	*   e.g., obligations for persistence, back-up, in event of failure, etc.
*   Proven model: successfully transitioned the management of persistent identifiers between different registrants and between different RAs
*   US "Not for profit" open membership (with membership fee)
*   Federation of Registration Agencies makes up majority of the IDF
*   Elected Board
*   No full time staff (contracted outsourced functions)

### Business Model

*   IDF receives membership fees from RAs, contracts technical operator
*   RAs are members of IDF and pay a fixed fee per year
*   Costs of operating the system are divided across RAs so that IDF is cost-neutral
*   Assigners are customers of RAs
*   RAs might have their own existing numbering scheme, existing communities etc. – which can be integrated with a DOI Application not replaced by it.
*   RAs are _autonomous independent bodies_. They offer services to assigners using DOI names
	*   RAs' business model with their customers is entirely autonomous
	*   RAs only obligation to IDF is a licence/operating agreement
	*   RAs may choose to put DOI names "under the hood"
*   Some RAs are commercial; others are themselves member communities

### Technical Infrastructure

*   _Handle System_: persistent identification in digital networks
*   _Vocabulary Mapping Framework_: data dictionary methodology for associated metadata
*   Both used elsewhere: aim was not to re-invent the wheel

### Standardization

*   ISO 26324, Information and Documentation — Digital Object Identifier System (2012)
*   Mechanism for, and emphasis on, enabling re-use of other existing identifier schemes, e.g., ISBN; see "[DOI System and Standard Identifier Schemes](../doi-system-and-standard-identifier-schemes)".

### Documentation

*   Website: [https://www.doi.org/](https://www.doi.org/)
*   [DOI® Handbook](../hb.html) – main source of definitive information
*   [Factsheets](/the-identifier/resources/) – coverage of selected topics in detail

### Origin

*   1996 proposal from the three major international publishing trade associations to develop infrastructure for digital publishing;
*   Need in the digital supply chain for an equivalent of the analogue bar code: migration from analogue to digital networked content cannot rely on URLs as identifiers (e.g., due to "linkrot": "404 not found")

### Relation to other schemes

*   Strong focus on interoperability and on working with existing and new schemes; technical, syntactic, and semantic interoperability
*   Adopt existing proven components

### Intellectual Property Considerations

*   IDF owns DOI®, a registered trademark for the system
*   IDF does not have any patents (or patent applications) on DOI System
*   IDF collectively licences appropriate technology from suppliers on behalf of members
*   [Patent Policy](/resources/130718-trademark-policy.pdf) in place
*   All RAs must sign RA agreement re use of IDF System
*   IDF is a participant in related projects
