# 1. How do I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)?
You must use a service offered by a DOI Registration Agency (RA). RAs collect metadata, assign DOI names, and offer other services such as reference linking or metadata lookup. See the [list of RAs](/the-community/existing-registration-agencies/) and contact the ones whose services best meet your needs. If you do not see an appropriate RA listed, consider developing a community to build the service you require (see the DOI Handbook for more information). You do not need to be a member of The DOI Foundation in order to work with an RA.  
# 2. How much does it cost to get a DOI and use the DOI system?
The cost of registering new DOI names depends on the services you purchase. Contact a DOI Registration Agency to discuss your options. Each RA is different, and each is free to offer its own business model. For an example of the costs of a DOI service, see the [DataCite](https://datacite.org/feemodel.html) fee model. Existing DOI names are, and will always be, free to resolve.
