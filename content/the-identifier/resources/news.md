### BSI Identify (2021) 
Announcing our newest registration agency, BSI Identify. BSI Identify is a new service operated by BSI to provide unambiguous identification for products and the long-term persistent storage of associated product information that can be accessed using a digital ID called a UPIN (Unique Persistent Identification Number) which is powered by the DOI.

The BSI service provides a consistent approach to identification of construction products that supports the construction industry as it continues to digitize and addresses critical safety issues.
