### HAND join as General Member (July 2022)
Human & Digital (HAND) joined the DOI Foundation as a General Member with the intention of becoming a Registration Agency. HAND is planning to assigning DOI names to legal entity humans, licensed virtual humans, and fictional characters involved in the performing arts and sports. The talent industry is becoming more connected, complex, and digitized. Managing this complexity in a programmatic way is only possible with verifiable, persistent identity of talent, both human and digital.

### Article published by DiSSCo team concerning their choice of PID (July 2021)
Hardisty et al have recently published an article entitled: [Choice of persistent identifier schemes for the Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo)](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.7.e67379). This articles details their analysis of persistant identifer (PID) systems and their suitability for the needs of Natural Science Collections. The authors have made a structured qualitative assessment of social and technical compliance across several assessment dimensions: levels of scalability, community trust, persistence, governance, appropriateness of the scheme and suitability for future global adoption. The results are discussed in relation to branding, community perceptions and global context to determine a preferred PID scheme for DiSSCo that also has potential for adoption and acceptance globally. This article will be very helpful for other orgnizations and consortia faced with the question of which PID system to choose. \

### DiSSCo join as General Member (April 2021)
The Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo) is a new Research Infrastructure (RI) for Natural Science Collections. The DiSSCo RI aims to create a new business model for one European collection that digitally unifies all European natural science assets under common access, curation, policies and practices that ensure that all the data is easily Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR principles). DiSSCo has joined the DOI Foundation as a General Member with the intention of becoming a Registration Agency in 2024.
