title: "DOI AND STANDARDS (ISO 26324)"
text: "We believe that standardization provides a further guarantee of good governance and persistence. The DOI system has been standardized through the International Standards Organization, as ISO 26324, Digital Object Identifier System. The Standard was approved in November 2010, published in May 2012 and revised in 2022. The history is described here . The Standard specifies the syntax and the functional components of the DOI System, plus the general principles for the creation, registration and administration of DOI names. The Standard is careful not to stipulate any specific technologies."
