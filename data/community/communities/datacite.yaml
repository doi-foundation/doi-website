maintext: "DataCite is a global non-profit organization that provides DOIs for research data and all other research outputs. By assigning DataCite DOIs, research outputs become discoverable and associated metadata is made available to the community. DataCite develops additional services to make it easy to connect and share research outputs with the broader research ecosystem and to assess the use of outputs within that ecosystem. All organizations within the research community can join DataCite to start registering DOIs."
