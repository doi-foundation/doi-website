title: "Try resolving a DOI"
maintext: "Type or paste a known DOI—including its prefix and suffix exactly—into the text box below and then resolve it."
subtext: "DOIs include a prefix (which _always_ start `10.`) and a suffix. Prefacing the DOI with `doi.org/` will turn it into an actionable link. Clicking that link will 'resolve' it i.e. take you to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves. Try this example from the scientific research community: http://doi.org/10.47366/sabia.v5n1a3."
