title: "Try resolving a DOI"
maintext: "Type or paste a known DOI exactly—including its prefix and suffix—into the text box below and then 'submit' to resolve it."
subtext: "DOIs include a prefix (prefixes always start with `10.`) and a suffix, separated by a forward slash (`/`). Prefacing the DOI with `doi.org/` will turn it into an actionable link, for example, http://doi.org/10.47366/sabia.v5n1a3. Clicking that link will 'resolve' it, i.e. redirect to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves."
