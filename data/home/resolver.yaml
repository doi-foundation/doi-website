title: "Try resolving a DOI"
maintext: "Type or paste a known DOI exactly—including its prefix and suffix—into the text box below and then 'submit' to resolve it."
subtext: "DOIs include a prefix (prefixes _always_ start with `10.`) and a suffix, separated by a forward slash (`/`). Prefacing the DOI with `doi.org/` will turn it into an actionable link. Clicking that link will 'resolve' it i.e. redirect to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves. Try this example from the scientific research community: http://doi.org/10.47366/sabia.v5n1a3."
