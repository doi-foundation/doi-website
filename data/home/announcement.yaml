title: "DOI Proxy Milestone"
maintext: "
In December 2025, we passed the 3 Billion proxy resolution mark with a total of 3,071,362,438 resolutions for the month.  Proxy resolutions have steadily increased over the years but nevertheless this is a significant milestone. To put it into perspective, it means that DOIs are resolved more than 1146 times a second or say it another way a DOI is resolved at the doi.org proxy once every 0.37 microseconds.

We know that a lot of this usage comes from machines rather than humans but we can’t be sure how much. 19% of this usage comes from machines that have identified themselves as such but we’re pretty sure this is a low estimate of the amount of machine use.

This astonishing level of proxy use is a tribute to our resilient and scalable infrastructure that was built and is maintained by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) on our behalf.
