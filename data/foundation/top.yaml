maintext: "We govern the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system on behalf of the agencies who manage DOI registries and provide services to their respective communities. We are the registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI system and we are governed by our Registration Agencies."
subtext: "Identification is vital in many industries, from tracking products along a supply chain, to sharing and providing access to critical information online. It is not enough to identify a thing when it is created; it must be traceable long into the future too. The Registration Agencies that govern us ensure the shared DOI infrastructure persists."
