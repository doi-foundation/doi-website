title: "THE DOI FOUNDATION HAS A LEAN SUSTAINABILITY MODEL"
maintext: "The costs incurred by the DOI Foundation in running the DOI System are recouped from the annual fees paid by the Registration Agencies and the other Members. In other words, we are self-funded. Together with a long-term sustainability fund, this is a model that allows us to promise persistence."
