title: "THE DOI FOUNDATION IS BOUND BY STANDARDS"
maintext: "The DOI System is an ISO Standard (ISO 26324) and the DOI Foundation is an ISO Registration Authority. This means we are legally bound to maintain the DOI System and comply with its rules. It also means that the DOI System continues to exist if for some reason the Foundation cannot continue to function. Itâ€™s our obsession with persistence."
