Such persistent identification doesn’t happen automatically, someone has to commit to keeping track of things as they move around. That’s where the DOI community comes in. The DOI Foundation is a community of communities.

Everything we do is in support of our [Registration Agencies (RAs)](/the-community/existing-registration-agencies/) and the other [Members](/the-community/who-are-the-members-and-users/). In turn, RAs provide additional services for their own user communities. They govern the DOI Foundation—and collaborate with each other through us—in order to maintain high standards and learn from each other to improve services. This social infrastructure ensures persistence just as much as the technical infrastructure does."
