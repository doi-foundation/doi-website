Each RA nominates someone to be a DOI Foundation [Board](/the-foundation/board) Director. Together they are responsible for the continuing operation of the DOI Foundation and the DOI System. In practice, this means they meet regularly to learn from each, share best practices, and they think a lot about persistence. One key committment is that they all agree to take on the responsibilities of another DOI agency if it stops being an RA, ensuring contunuity and persistence of DOIs.
