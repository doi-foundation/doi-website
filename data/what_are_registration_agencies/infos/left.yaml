maintext: "
It is expected that RAs deliver a reliable and consistent DOI service to their users. They agree to abide by our common agreements and policies. They sign an Agreement (here is a sample) to sign which: 

- grants a set of rights; 

- stipulates the obligations of the RA and the DOI Foundation; 

- makes clear the intellectual property rights; and 

- details change and termination procedures as well as continuity considerations.
