maintext: "Registration Agencies (RAs) provide services to people or organisations who need to identify and track the things that matter to them. Their work involves allocating DOI prefixes, registering DOI names, and providing a metadata schema associated with each DOI record."
subtext: "As each RA represents an industry or a community, most have developed unique services that build on top of the basic DOI registration that are useful for the communities they serve. Every RA is different but they all abide by certain commitments."
