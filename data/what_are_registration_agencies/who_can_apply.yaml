title: "WHO CAN APPLY TO BE AN RA?"
toptext: "
Any organization from any sector that is willing to make long-term commitments to the persistence and sustainability of the DOI System. They can be commercial, governmental, or not-for-profit. 
 
New RAs tend to be a group of organizations within a particular sector who are collaborating to solve a common problem together - a solution to persistent identification. Often, a representative of such a community group will join as a DOI Foundation member, before making a detailed business case to apply to become an RA.

Applications are considered by the Board, based on a thorough review of their case. 
 
Our experience is that the key to becoming a successful and sustainable Registration Agency is the development of additional services that add clear value on top of DOI registration for a unique new community group. For example:"
