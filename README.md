# Welcome to the DOI Foundation's website repository ![githubworkflow]

This is where the DOI community manages the organization's main website. 
CNRI is the sysadmin and Cazinc is the webadmin. 
We are just getting started with a refresh due to go live Autumn 2022.

## Deployment
Deployment will be managed by a github action - depending on the branch pushed it will be to either of the S3 bucket endpoints that represent the staging and 'new-live' websites.
