# Welcome to the DOI Foundation's website repository

This is where the DOI community manages the organization's main website. 
CNRI is the sysadmin and Cazinc is the webadmin. 
We are just getting started with a refresh due to go live Autumn 2022.

## Deployment
Deployment will be managed by a github action - depending on the branch pushed it will be to either of the S3 bucket endpoints that represent the staging and 'new-live' websites.
