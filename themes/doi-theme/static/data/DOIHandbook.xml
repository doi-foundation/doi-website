                    Notice: The DOI Foundation welcomes the publication of the Digital Object
                    Identifier Resolution Protocol (DO-IRP). This specification is made available
                    by DONA, a Swiss Foundation set up to govern the Handle System® (as used by the
                    DOI infrastructure) and promote associated specifications. The Handle System
                    was previously specified only in "informative" documents and the publication of
                    proven, normative documents that remove features that were never implemented
                    will increase the robustness and reliability of the DOI infrastructure. This
                    infrastructure is used over 12 billion times a year to resolve over 300 million
                    DOI names across the different sectors that rely on it. Most users access the
                    DOI infrastructure through the resilient network of web proxies at
                    https://doi.org and never encounter the Handle System directly, but this
                    publication will ensure that the DOI System remains world-class into the future.

            <title>DOI System Overview</title>
            <p>This chapter introduces the DOI System's history, purpose, basic principles, benefits
                and applications.</p>

                <title>History and Purpose of the DOI System</title>
                <p>The DOI® (Digital Object Identifier) System originated in a joint initiative of
                    three trade associations in the publishing industry (International Publishers
                    Association; International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical
                    Publishers; Association of American Publishers). Although originating in text
                    publishing, the DOI System was conceived as a generic framework for managing
                    identification of content over digital networks, recognizing the trend towards
                    digital convergence and multimedia availability. The system was announced at the
                    Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. In the same year, the DOI Foundation was created to
                    develop and manage the DOI System.</p>
                <p>From its inception the DOI Foundation worked with the <ext-link
                        xlink:href="https://www.cnri.reston.va.us">Corporation for National Research
                        Initiatives</ext-link> (CNRI<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"

                    </fn> developed by CNRI as the digital network component of the DOI System. CNRI

                <p>The DOI System provides a technical and social infrastructure on which
                    organizations can build applications to provide services to users or communities
                    of users. For example, the DOI System is used in internal processes in multiple
                    industries, for publishing and reporting across corporate and national
                    boundaries, and in the field of semantic web applications.</p>
                <p>Because of the widespread implementation of the DOI System, the DOI Foundation
                    was invited to propose it as an ISO standard. <ext-link
                        xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/88862.html">ISO 26324</ext-link>
                    was published in 2012,updated in 2022, and again in 2025. The ISO standard
                    specifies the syntax and operation of the DOI while leaving implementation
                    issues to the Foundation, which acts as registration authority for the standard.
                    Note that the DOI Syntax was originally a National Information Standards
                    Organization (US) standard, ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2010, first published in 2000 and
                    withdrawn in 2017.</p>

                        landing page with access to further resources, etc. For example, a DOI name
                        representing an article resolves to the web address of the HTML file version

                        by the DOI Foundation. Metadata is used to provide services to the users: it
                        can be displayed to users to enrich an information resource; it can be used

                    <p>A DOI name is a global unique identifier of an entity (called the referent).
                        The referent can be any digital, physical or abstract entity, and it can be
                        defined on any granularity level of an entity depending on the requirements
                        of the Registration Agency (RA); and a DOI name may identify a specific
                        edition of a novel, a novel chapter, a small piece of musical recording,
                        etc. Referents can be intellectual property where examples would include
                        inventions, literary and artistic works, ideas, symbols, names, images,
                        designs, etc.</p>
                    <p>A DOI name can be resolved, through a Handle System service, to a set of
                        elements, called the DOI record, as illustrated below. The DOI record
                        usually contains a web address (or URL for Unified Resource Locator)
                        representing an instance of the referent, and may contain services such as
                        email, and one or more items of data about the referent (metadata).</p>

                    <p>The DOI name is persistent over time. Its persistence is provided by the
                        independence of the identifier name from the element values, in particular
                        from the entity localization or ownership. These elements can change over
                        time: through the DOI name resolution, users will always get the up-to-date
                        element values (This requires that the DOI record data be regularly
                        maintained.). </p>
                    <p content-type="note">Each element of the DOI record is assigned an explicit type (for
                        example, "URL" (web address) or "email"). Predefined types exist in the
                        Handle System and new types can be added by RAs, making the DOI resolution
                        system extremely flexible and responsive to new requirements.</p>

                        and a <index-term ref="sec1.3.2">suffix</index-term> separated by a forward slash character (“/”), e.g.:</p>
                    <p content-type="centered-large">10.1000/292</p>
                    <p>The prefix (“10.1000” in the example above) identifies the person or
                        organization that has requested and received the registration of the DOI
                        name (the registrant). It consists of one or more segments separated by the
                        full-stop character (“.”) Currently, all DOI names start with the segment
                        “10”. The suffix (“292” in the example above) is chosen by the registrant
                        identified by the prefix and is unique for a given prefix. It is an
                        arbitrary string. This can be specific to the registrant or incorporate an
                        identifier generated from, or based on, another system. See Chapter 3 for
                        detailed information on the syntax of DOI names.</p>
                    <p>No definitive information can be inferred about a referent from a DOI name
                        alone. In particular, the inclusion in a DOI name of any registrant code
                        allocated to a specific registrant does not provide evidence of the
                        ownership of rights or current management responsibility of any intellectual
                        property in the referent. Such information may be asserted in the associated
                        metadata.</p>
                    <p>DOI names can be represented in a number of ways depending on the context,
                        including as URLs, URNs and URIs, as described in 3.5.</p>

                <p>The basic resolution function of the DOI System consists in redirecting a user to
                    a web resource on resolution of a DOI name. The end-user can perform this basic

                    <p>The most common resolution function of a DOI name returns a single web
                        address (or URL for Uniform Resource Locator) to which the user is
                        redirected as illustrated below. This is done by using the HTTPS Proxy
                        Server of the DOI System (https://doi.org). With the DOI Proxy, users can
                        resolve DOI names from any standard web browser by using the URL syntax (A
                        proxy server is a web server that understands the Handle System protocol,
                        thereby acting as a gateway between the Handle System and HTTPS.). For
                        example, the resolution of the DOI name "10.10.123/456" would be done from
                        the address "https://doi.org/10.123/456". That makes the DOI resolution

                        <list-item>The DOI Foundation allocates one or several prefixes derived from
                            its top-level prefix (10) to an organization that wishes to register DOI
                            names (a Registration Agency (RA)).</list-item>
                        <list-item>The RA registers DOI names under their allocated prefix(es). If
                            the RA allocates a separate prefix to each of their customers
                            (registrants) then the combination of a prefix for the registrant and
                            suffix provided by the registrant (which is unique within their prefix)
                            avoids any necessity for the centralized allocation of DOI

                                        the DOI Foundation will make best efforts to transfer such
                                        services to another agency, or maintain such services
                                        itself, or encourage that services are transferred to a
                                        third party able to provide continuity where required. The
                                        aim will be to provide the least disturbance to the

                    <p>The DOI System provides the means for a solution to the famous web issue of
                        “http 404 not found” (broken link).</p>
                    <p>The problem is that a URL (Unified Resource Locator) is both an identifier
                        and a locator for a resource on the Internet. The specific content of the
                        URL that is its identifier is also the string that can be resolved into a
                        location. This has the consequence that when a resource is moved from one
                        service to another, from a server to another, or from a company to another,
                        it will get a new URL that identifies the service, the server or the company
                        that hosts it. Its old URL will most likely stop working and any previously
                        made references to that resource using the old URL will no longer work.</p>
                    <p>With the DOI System, the identifier is persistent, whereas the metadata to
                        which it resolves can change over time, in particular, the URL can be
                        updated. For more information, see Chapter 3.</p>

                    <title>Identifier Interoperability through a Powerful Metadata Model</title>
                    <p>Resources of interest in digital networks originate from a wide variety of
                        sources, and may carry identifiers from different established public
                        schemes, official standards, de facto schemes, or private cataloguing
                        numbering. A key step in facilitating preservation, re-use and exchange of
                        information is to enable users to re-use these identifiers (and their
                        associated data) across different applications. </p>
                    <p>For example, where several Registry Agencies (RA) are issuing DOI names to
                        journal articles from different publishers, it is likely that some RAs and
                        publishers will want their DOI names to be included in journal-related
                        services supported by other RAs. In a similar way, many RAs will want DOI
                        names issued by other RAs to be available for inclusion in services they
                        themselves are providing. Such interoperability is one of the principal
                        benefits of the DOI System.</p>
                    <p>To achieve identifier interoperability in the DOI System, tools and policies
                        are used: see 1.4.</p>

                    <p>The DOI System is not meant to replace existing identifier systems. Instead,
                        it is designed for interoperability; that is to use, or work with, existing
                        identifier and metadata schemes. </p>
                    <p>The DOI System explicitly recognizes other schemes. The ISO DOI specification
                        (ISO 26324) sets out the specifications for recognizing existing schemes. At
                        minimum, the System Metadata must record the fact that another registry
                        identifier exists. Additional optional steps are possible, including:</p>

                        (an LHS manages the DOI names under one or several prefixes): each LHS may

                    <list>
                        <list-item><bold>General Membership</bold> This membership is offered to any
                            organization supporting the development of the DOI System that is not a
                            Registration Agency. It is subject to a <ext-link
                                xlink:href="https://www.doi.org/resources/GeneralMemberAgreement.pdf"
                                >signed agreement</ext-link>. General membership is a pre-requisite
                            for any organization applying to become a Registration Agency. If a
                            General Member subsequently is appointed as a Registration Agency, their
                            membership transfers from the General to the RA category. </list-item>
                        <list-item>
                            <bold>Registration Agency Membership</bold> This membership is only
                            available to organizations who have successfully undergone the process
                            of becoming a Registration Agency (RA) (see 2.2.5). The primary role of
                            RAs is to provide services and applications to registrants by allocating
                            DOI prefixes, registering DOI names and providing the necessary
                            infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain System
                            Metadata and DOI records. For more information about RAs, see
                            2.2.</list-item>
                        <list-item>
                            <bold>Charter Membership</bold> This membership was initially
                            established for founding the DOI Foundation and is only offered to
                            organizations whose main activities are in the creation or production
                            and dissemination of intellectual property. The DOI Board reserves the
                            right to determine eligibility for the Charter membership
                            category.</list-item>
                        <list-item>
                            <bold>Affiliate Membership</bold> This membership is restricted to
                            professional associations who have one or more of their current members
                            in current membership of the DOI Foundation. Organizations outside this
                            scope may be invited or admitted at the Board's sole discretion.
                            Affiliate membership does not carry voting rights, and Affiliate members
                            are not eligible for Board membership. Registration Agencies are not
                            eligible for this category of membership.</list-item>
                    </list>
                    <p>General, Registration Agency and Charter members are entitled to vote in
                        annual DOI Foundation's elections within their own category of membership
                        (There are no differences in member rights and benefits between Charter and
                        General.). Affiliate membership does not carry voting rights.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: In general, it is likely that the cost of fees will be deductible as a
                        business expense of the joining entity. The detailed question of
                        deductibility is, however, a matter for the tax advisors of the entity that
                        is joining, and it is not governed by DOI Foundation's status as a
                        not-for-profit entity. </p>
                    <subtitle>MEMBER STRATEGY MEETINGS</subtitle>
                    <p>Strategy meetings of the DOI Foundation members are held at least once a
                        year, and usually one in mid-year and one at the end of the year, and are
                        open to all members and non-member guests (by invitation only). Members are
                        advised of forthcoming meetings by email.</p>
                    <subtitle>DOI REPRESENTATIVE OF A MEMBER ORGANIZATION</subtitle>
                    <p>Each member organization of the DOI Foundation must provide one named DOI
                        representative, who will be responsible for the DOI matters. In particular,
                        the DOI representative will represent the organization at all Board meetings
                        and in voting issues. Members must ensure that the DOI Foundation is kept
                        informed of any representative changes. Should the individual leave the
                        member organization, or step down from the representation role, the
                        organization will name a replacement.</p>
                    <p>Additional persons from the member organization may participate in all DOI
                        activities.</p>
                    <subtitle>TRIAL PREFIX</subtitle>
                    <p>On joining the DOI Foundation, a unique DOI prefix is available for
                        experimental purposes for each member. The number of DOI names allocated
                        with this experimental prefix will be subject to review and may be limited
                        at the discretion of the DOI Foundation. If further DOI prefixes are
                        required for non-experimental purposes, members must work with one of the
                        Registration Agency members. Trial prefix use is particularly intended for
                        those members wishing to develop applications and move to later Registration
                        Agency status.</p>

                    communities of users and providing tailored services for them. A registrant is a

                        standards established by the DOI Foundation, but are free to develop their

                        or not for profit). Examples of the functions of an organization which might
                        become an RA include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <list>
                        <list-item>An organization is running a registry (of identifiers and related

                        <list-item>An existing aggregator of information wishes to use DOIs to

                        <list-item>A new initiative is launched in a defined sector to meet specific
                            needs or solve a problem, for example, an industry collaboration or
                            effort to solve a common problem (examples of these including Crossref,
                            DataCite and EIDR are amongst the most successful existing
                            RAs).</list-item>
                        <list-item>A start-up which has a business model suggesting a novel DOI
                            application might be fruitful: in view of the importance of persistence,

                        <list-item>explicit charging based on the number of prefixes allocated or

                    <p>Operational costs of the system are borne directly or indirectly by the
                        registrants. The business model adopted by an individual RA is a matter for
                        the RA alone, provided that it complies with the DOI Foundation's
                        policies.</p>
                    <p content-type="note">RAs may choose to provide other DOI System-related
                        services to registrants, without limitation as long as they conform with DOI
                        agreements and policies. These services may include any combination of value
                        added services in, for example, data, content or rights management. RAs may
                        also develop services that exploit the metadata that they collect.</p>
                    <p>RAs will typically register many thousands or millions of DOI names, and have
                        mul-tiple customers and services, thereby generating economies of scale. RAs
                        for smaller scale applications will probably not be viable as stand-alone
                        entities, though RAs may collaborate, for example to share back-office
                        services to improve viability. Communities that cannot identify an
                        acceptable RA should contact the DOI Foundation to discuss how the DOI
                        System might be used, and whether a new RA application might be
                        developed.</p>

                    <title>Service Non-Exclusivity and Competition Matters</title>
                    <p>Exclusivity of DOI name registration rights covering either a specific
                        geographic territory or a wide area of application in general (for example,
                        audio) will not normally be granted to any Registration Agency (RA).
                        Exceptions are possible, for example where the RA is mandated to operate as
                        a service for an existing closed community and will not offer their
                        registration services outside that community. DOI applications often overlap
                        and in the digital world any number of categorisations are possible, which
                        makes exclusive arrangements difficult. The only exception at present is an
                        implementation for the Publications Office of the EU, covering DOI
                        registration and management of official EU documents.</p>
                    <p>In order to maintain a persistent identifier, a DOI application normally
                        provides more value than simply registering a DOI, by offering an added
                        value service such as citation linking or metadata management. RAs operate
                        as independent businesses on the basis of these added-value services and
                        unique selling propositions they bring to offer to the market. In order to
                        provide some coherence of DOI services, applications to become an RA are
                        assessed in the context of likely business implications. Where there is an
                        overlap of the expected market or services of RAs, each will be informed of
                        the potential for overlap or competition and invited to address the problem
                        in such a way as to encourage uptake of the DOI System as a whole whilst
                        ensuring that legitimate business interests are met.</p>

                            the existing RAs for examples of services and operations. See also

                        The cost of common DOI infrastructure (managed by the DOI Foundation on
                        behalf of all Registration Agencies) is met by a charge made to each
                        Registration Agency, whilst allowing each Registration Agency to adopt
                        individual commercial models incorporating DOI name registration for their

                <title>Assignment Principles of the DOI Name</title>
                <p>The following principles for assigning DOI names apply:</p>
                <list>
                    <list-item>A DOI name can be assigned to any object whenever there is a
                        functional need to distinguish it from other objects. DOI names can be
                        assigned at any desired degree of precision and granularity that a
                        Registration Agency deems to be appropriate based on the needs of their
                        community. </list-item>
                    <list-item>Each DOI name shall specify one and only one referent in the DOI
                        System.</list-item>
                    <list-item>The assignment of a DOI name requires that the registrant provide
                        metadata describing the object to which the DOI name is being assigned. The
                        metadata shall describe the object to the degree that is necessary to
                        distinguish it as a separate entity within the DOI System.</list-item>
                    <list-item>No time limit for the existence of a DOI name shall be assumed in any
                        assignment (see 1.9).</list-item>
                    <list-item>A DOI name shall not be used as a replacement for other ISO
                        identifier schemes.</list-item>
                </list>
                <p content-type="note">While a referent can be specified by more than one DOI name,
                    it is usually recommended that each referent has only one DOI name. But
                    depending on the DOI application, there may be legitimate reasons to assign
                    multiple DOIs to the same referent.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="sec3.2">
                <title>Use of Unicode</title>
                <p>To support diverse applications worldwide, a DOI name can use any Unicode
                    character intended to be written, printed, or otherwise displayed in a form that
                    can be read by humans.</p>
                <p>With this flexibility comes ambiguities when representing or exchanging DOI
                    names. For example:</p>
                <list>
                    <list-item>the character "Á" (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE) can be encoded
                        either on its own or as the character "A" (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) followed
                        by the combining character ◌́ (COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT);</list-item>
                    <list-item>multiple schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32) can be used when
                        serializing a DOI name to bytes for interchange between
                        machines;</list-item>
                    <list-item>the glyph "Å" can either correspond to the ANGSTROM SIGN or the LATIN
                        CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE.</list-item>
                </list>
                <p>To avoid these pitfalls, this document specifies the syntax of a DOI name as a
                    sequence of Unicode code points, where each code point is an integer between 0
                    and 0x10FFFF, and the fundamental unit of encoding in Unicode.</p>

                    <p>A DOI name consists of an ordered sequence of code points of the Graphic
                        type, as specified in the Unicode Standard. The Graphic type includes all
                        code points that are letter, mark, number, punctuation, symbol and spaces.
                        It excludes, for example, control code points such as U+0009 HORIZONTAL
                        TABULATION.</p>
                    <p>The sequence is further arranged in a DOI prefix and a DOI suffix separated

                        prefix and “SMPTE.ST2067-21.2020” is the DOI suffix</p>
                    <p>There is no defined limit on the length of the DOI name, or of the DOI prefix

                        prefix, “10” is the directory indicator and “5594” is the registrant
                        code.</p>
                    <p>The directory indicator consists of a sequence of digits between 0 and 9. It
                        is usually equal to “10” but other directory indicators may be used in the
                        future by the DOI Foundation.</p>
                    <p>The registrant code consists of sequences of digits between 0 and 9,
                        separated by U+002E FULL STOP.</p>
                    <p>EXAMPLE 2: In the hypothetical “10.500.100” DOI prefix, the directory
                        indicator is “10” and the registrant code is “500.100”.</p>

                    <p>When comparing two DOI names for equivalence, no normalization, as defined in
                        ISO/IEC 10646, is performed and the DOI names are equivalent if, and only
                        if, their code point sequences are identical, except that a code point in
                        the range U+0041..U+005A (corresponding to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN
                        CAPITAL LETTER Z) is considered identical to the corresponding code point in
                        the range U+0061..U+007A (corresponding to characters LATIN SMALL LETTER A
                        to LATIN SMALL LETTER Z).</p>
                    <p>The rule above has the effect of making DOI names case-insensitive only when

                    <p>The advantages of case sensitivity (librarian and publisher practice, human
                        readability and expectations) are outweighed by considerations of data
                        integrity. Case sensitivity practice across Internet applications varies:
                        DNS is not, the rest of URLs are except sometimes they aren't (this depends
                        on the server), Unix vs PC/Mac file names (Microsoft Windows in general is
                        not case-sensitive, Unix operating systems are always case sensitive),
                        markup language tags, etc. can all cause unexpected problems and one cannot
                        guarantee that any particular piece of software will respect case
                        sensitivity and not conflate two DOI names intended to be different. Some
                        search engines and directories are partially case sensitive. Different web
                        browsers may differ in case sensitive handling (web browser developers have
                        advised that "authors should not rely on case-sensitivity as a way of
                        creating distinct identifiers, unless they are designing solely for a truly
                        standards-compliant browser").</p>
                    <p>This argued in favor of limited case insensitivity being the safer, and more
                        robust, option for future evolution and development of the DOI System.</p>

                            keyboard data entry in the absence of any automated protocol

                        <list-item>· identifier schemes such as URL have no check digit: the
                            underlying TCP/IP protocol they use has an error-correction component.
                            This aids creation and use.</list-item>
                    </list>
                    <p>However, other applications may make use of check digits, so a checksum digit
                        may be inserted into a DOI name if it would be useful for some other
                        application. Use of checksums in a particular DOI System application can be
                        introduced as a rule of that application by the Registration Agency
                        concerned. An example is the EIDR application, where the check character is
                        computed only over the DOI suffix. It does not include the prefix because if
                        the prefix is wrong, it is highly probable that the DOI name will go to an
                        incorrect resolution system anyway. The EIDR registry separately validates
                        the prefix of any DOI name sent through its API. </p>

                        Registration Agencies may elect to use the HTTP Proxy form (see 3.5.4). It
                        is then advantageous to use some convention of showing both the plain DOI
                        name and a way to resolve it online (a shorthand way of saying "the DOI name

                        the web through https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.999" or "...available via

                        sequences of code points can result in similar presentations. For example,

                        &lt;U+0061, U+0301&gt;. As detailed at 3.6, the URI, URN and HTTP Proxy

                <title>Avoiding and Resolving Ambiguities when Presenting or Exchanging DOI
                    Names</title>
                <p>As discussed at 3.3, the flexibility that comes with Unicode can introduce
                    ambiguities when representing or exchanging DOI names. The following discusses
                    approaches to mitigate these ambiguities.</p>
                <p>The DOI name can be represented using a form that is unambiguous. In particular,
                    the URI, URN and HTTP Proxy forms specified at 3.5 are self-identifying and
                    appropriate for both human consumption and machine exchange. In these forms,
                    code points that fall outside a very small set of unambiguous code points are
                    transformed, using a process called percent-encoding, into a sequence of
                    unambiguous code points. Strictly for machine exchange, the DOI name can be
                    serialized as a UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 string.</p>
                <p>A Registration Authority can choose code points exclusively from the Unicode
                    Basic Latin block when crafting DOI suffixes.</p>

            <section id="sec3.6">
                <title>UTF-8 Serialization</title>
                <p>UTF-8 is a common Unicode serialization scheme that encodes each Unicode code
                    point as an unsigned byte sequence of one to four bytes in length.</p>
                <p>UTF-8 has the useful property that Unicode code points in the Basic Latin block
                    are mapped to their US-ASCII equivalent.</p>
                <p>EXAMPLE 1: The Japanese word 日本語 (nihongo) corresponds to the sequence of code
                    points &lt;U+65E5, U+672C, U+8A9E&gt;. This is serialized to the UTF-8 string
                    &lt;E6 97 A5 E6 9C AC E8 AA 9E&gt;.</p>
                <p>EXAMPLE 2: The English word “bye” corresponds to the sequence of code points
                    &lt;U+0062, U+0079, U+0065&gt;. This is serialized to the UTF-8 string &lt;62 79

                <title>Percent-Encoding</title>
                <p>The percent-encoding algorithm specified at RFC 3986 is applied whenever a DOI
                    name is used in the path component of a URL, such as in the HTTP Proxy Form
                    (3.5.4) or when calling an HTTP API (10.3). This algorithm achieves two
                    objectives: preventing conflict with characters with special meaning in URLs,
                    e.g., “/”, and mapping non-US-ASCII characters to a sequence of US-ASCII
                    characters.</p>
                <p>The percent-encoded representation of a DOI name is formed by first applying the
                    following algorithm to each of its prefix and suffix separately:</p>
                <list list-type="numbered">
                    <list-item>the ordered sequence of Unicode code points of the DOI Prefix or
                        Suffix is expressed as a UTF-8 String (see 3.7), without the byte order
                        mark and without any normalization; </list-item>
                    <list-item> for every byte in the UTF-8 String: 
                        <list list-type="alpha">
                            <list-item>output the byte unmodified if the byte is one of the
                                following: ALPHA , DIGIT , "-" , "." , "_" , "~", "!" , "$" ,
                                "&amp;" , "'" , "(" , ")" , "*" , "+" , ";" , "=" , ":", or
                                "@"</list-item>
                            <list-item>otherwise, replace the byte with the US-ASCII byte triplet
                                resulting from percent-encoding the byte.</list-item>
                        </list>
                    </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Second, the resulting encoded prefix and suffix are concatenated, separated by a
                    “/”.</p>
                <p>The ALPHA and DIGIT character sets are specified at IETF RFC 3986.</p>
                <p>The “,” byte is percent-encoded to allow percent-encoded DOI names to be used in
                    Which RA? Service requests (see 5.6).</p>
                <p>EXAMPLE: The DOI name 10.1000/456#789 is percent-encoded to “10.1000/456%23789”.
                    Thus the web browser does not encounter the bare “#”, which it would normally
                    treat as the end of the URL and the start of a fragment, and so sends the entire
                    string off to the DOI network of servers for resolution, instead of stopping at
                    the “#”.</p>

                <title>Introduction to System Metadata</title>
                <p>Without metadata, an identifier is of very little value. Metadata, which may be
                    defined in this context as information about an identified referent, provides
                    human beings or machines with the data they need to enable them to make use of
                    that identified referent. Metadata may include names, identifiers, descriptions,
                    types, classifications, locations, times, measurements, relationships and any
                    other kind of information related to a referent.</p>
                <p>Metadata may be grouped in different ways and it is useful to define terminology
                    for the different metadata groups that will exist for an identified entity
                    (referent). The following definitions are used when discussing DOIs:</p>
                <list>
                    <list-item>DOI System Metadata: Metadata for a referent that is defined in the
                        ISO 26324 standard and also provided in Section 10.1 of this document. Its
                        purpose is to ensure consistent description of the referent within a
                        referent sub-type and to enable users to distinguish one DOI record from
                        another. This metadata is collected and stored by registration
                        agencies.</list-item>
                    <list-item>Registration Agency Metadata: Any metadata stored by a registration
                        agency as part of its activities. This includes DOI System Metadata, but
                        will often extend to other metadata that facilitates applications beyond the
                        distinguishing of records of the same referent subtype.</list-item>
                    <list-item>Referent metadata: All metadata that exists about the referent
                        regardless of where it is stored by a registration agency or
                        not.</list-item>
                    <list-item>Basic Metadata: Part of DOI System Metadata that allows sufficient
                        additional metadata to define what the referent is. Fields necessary will
                        depend on the Referent Type and Sub-Type.</list-item>
                    <list-item>Administrative Metadata: Descriptive elements used in DOI System
                        Metadata about the DOI Record.</list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Registration agencies are responsible for the collection and storage of metadata.
                    The registration agency determines where the metadata is stored and provides
                    access. In some cases this may be via the Handle System. But there is no
                    requirement for metadata records to be in the DOI record in the Handle
                    System.</p>
                <p>There are two ways in which every Registration Agency (RA) is bound to deal with
                    metadata as illustrated below:</p>
                <list>
                    <list-item>An RA will gather input metadata from referent providers (typically,
                        descriptions of the referents and associated rights and
                        policies).</list-item>
                    <list-item>An RA will need to provide some level of output or service metadata
                        to support DOI system services.</list-item>
                </list>

                    <p>A metadata declaration must be made for every entity identified with a DOI
                        name according to the following principles:</p>
                    <list>
                        <list-item>The declaration must contain a minimum set of mandatory metadata

                    </list>
                    <p>DOI data model policy places no restrictions on the form and content of input
                        and service metadata declarations of a Registration Agency (RA), except
                        insofar as input metadata must support the minimum requirements implicit in
                        the DOI System Metadata. RAs may specify their own metadata schemes and
                        messages, or use any existing schemes in whole or part for their input and
                        service metadata declarations.</p>
                    <subtitle>POLICY ON DOI NAME ADMINISTRATION</subtitle>
                    <p>The second aim of DOI data model policy is to ensure minimum standards of
                        quality of administration of DOI names by Registration Agencies (RA),and
                        facilitate the administration of the DOI System as a whole. This aim may
                        also be seen as supporting the first aim of interoperability, but it
                        specifically addresses the need to ensure that a prospective RA is competent
                        to issue DOI names responsibly and that ambiguous DOI names do not enter the
                        network.</p>
                    <p>The policy provides a simple test of an RA's competence: the ability to make
                        a DOI System Metadata Declaration, which requires that the RA has an
                        internal system which can support the unambiguous allocation of a DOI name,
                        and is fundamentally sound enough to support interoperability within the
                        network. In addition, the policy requires that RAs maintain a record of the
                        date of allocation of a DOI name, and the identity of the registrant on
                        whose behalf the DOI name was allocated.</p>
                    <p>The existence of a System Metadata expression for each DOI name helps with
                        the goal of persistence since this ensures that the referent for each DOI
                        name is described sufficient for the referent to be known. So, the referent
                        to which a DOI is assigned to is known through the expression of the System
                        Metadata for that referent.</p>
                    <p>The DOI System Metadata model policy also exists to support the future
                        development of mechanisms for facilitating the administration of the DOI
                        System as a whole. This might be done, for example, through the use of terms
                        registered as types/sub-types, to classify DOI names, or services.</p>

                    <list>
                        <list-item>recognition Recognition in this context means that the System
                            Metadata should be sufficient to show clearly what kind of thing is the
                            DOI referent (by various classifications), and allow a user to identify
                            with reasonable accuracy the particular thing (by various names,
                            identifiers and relationships). These two are complementary, for it is
                            possible to know that something is (for example) a movie or a DVD
                            without knowing that it is "Casablanca", and vice versa. Recognition is
                            required for the discovery of referents, and also to provide information
                            to a user when a referent is discovered, whether by intent or accident.
                            The user of metadata may be a person or a machine. The structure of the
                            System Metadata is sufficient to provide a unique description of a
                            referent (disambiguation), since further specialized metadata elements
                            may be required which is specified as Basic Metadata per Referent
                            SubType. A unique description can in fact always be achieved by adding
                            additional descriptive text to a referent, but this is not a
                            satisfactory way if the additional text is being used in place of a
                            formal classification, measurement, identifier, time or other structured
                            contextual metadata, as it undermines the second goal of
                            interoperability </list-item>
                        <list-item>interoperability Interoperability in this context means that
                            System Metadata from different DOI Registration Agencies may be combined
                            or queried by the same software application without requiring semantic
                            mapping or transformation. Interoperability is achieved when data
                            elements or their values are common to diverse metadata schemas. The
                            System Metadata provides this directly by mandating a common set of core
                            elements and classifications, but this of course supports only limited
                            interoperability. </list-item>

                <p>The aim of DOI System Metadata model policy is to promote interoperability within
                    the network of DOI name users. It does this by providing ways of achieving

                    <title>Motivations for Interoperability</title>
                    <p>Standardization of any kind is driven by a need for interoperability. If a
                        Registration Agency (RA) is issuing DOI names for referents for use within a
                        private domain where that RA is able to command all aspects of metadata
                        gathering and output, then it has no need for standardization or conformance
                        with DOI data model obligations. The RA will lay out its schemas and
                        declarations, and its providers and users should conform to them. Such a
                        situation is described as restricted use of the DOI System, and applies
                        typically where an organization becomes an RA for the specific purpose of
                        issuing DOI names for use only within its own private organization.</p>
                    <p>However, such isolation is unusual. Normally, when a DOI name is issued to a
                        referent, one fundamental assumption may be made about interoperability: the
                        RA or the referent provider may wish (now or in the future) that the DOI
                        name should be available for use in services provided by other RAs. For
                        example, where several RAs are issuing DOI names to journal articles from
                        different publishers, it is likely that some RAs and publishers will want
                        their DOI names to be included in journal-related services supported by
                        other RAs.</p>
                    <p>In a similar way, many RAs will want DOI names issued by other RAs to be
                        available for inclusion in services they themselves are providing. Such
                        interoperability is one of the principal benefits of the DOI System.</p>
                    <p>As the RA network grows, such requirements are emerging, and where specific
                        opportunities do not yet exist they are anticipated. In such circumstances
                        neither the RA nor the referent provider wishes to issue a second DOI name
                        for the referent, nor to provide and capture the input metadata all over
                        again from its source.</p>

                    key to realizing the full potential of the DOI System. This is also the
                    underlying objective of the Semantic Web and Linked Data: that the Web should be
                    seen as a medium for structured, interlinked and machine-processable
                    information, as much as, in its current form, a network of documents presenting
                    the information for human consumption.</p>
                <p>The DOI System Metadata exists to provide a basis of good practice and a start
                    point for the integration of metadata for different DOI referents. Initiatives
                    such as Linked Open Data provide further essential infrastructure, but only in
                    technology and syntax: they do not provide solutions at the level of shared
                    meaning (semantic alignment) for the automated integration of different datasets
                    which can allow services from different RAs and other parties to interact fully
                    without human inter-vention or a plethora of one-to-one "silo" solutions. </p>
                <p>The key to this is the development of well-structured metadata schemas and of
                    services which make use of the semantic mapping capabilities of the DOI System
                    Metadata Model. The DOI Foundation will provide support to their RAs where they
                    choose to co-operate in the development of such services.</p>

                        at any time. For example, a DOI name could resolve to a Java servlet, or

                    <p>The Handle System consists of a single distributed Global Handle Registry
                        (GHR), and unlimited number of Local Handle Services (LHS):</p>
                    <list>
                        <list-item>Identifiers (called Handles) are managed by LHSs. Handles under
                            the same prefix are managed by the same LHS.</list-item>
                        <list-item>The GHR stores the information necessary to locate the LHS
                            responsible for any Handle in the system.</list-item>
                    </list>
                    <p>To resolve a Handle, a Handle System client will first connect to the GHR
                        which will redirect it to the LHS responsible for the requested Handle. </p>
                    <p>To understand in more details how the GHR and LHS work, it is necessary to
                        introduce first the prefix Handle concept.</p>
                    <subtitle>INTRODUCTION TO PREFIX HANDLES (0.NA PREFIX)</subtitle>
                    <p>Specific Handles are used in the Handle System to represent the prefixes:</p>
                    <list>
                        <list-item>The Handle of a prefix is in the format

                            resolution) contains administration data for managing the prefix. For
                            example, 0.NA/10.100 record stores the location (service information) of
                            the LHS responsible for the resolution of DOI names under 10.100 (see
                            also a prefix handle example in section 10.5).</list-item>

                        authorized by the DONA Foundation to participate in the distributed
                        administration of the GHR is referred to as a Multi-Primary Administrator
                        (MPA). Each MPA is "credentialed" and allotted a zero-delimiter prefix by
                        the DONA Foundation. It operates its own GHR Service in accordance with the
                        Foundation procedures, and coordinates it with the other MPAs and DONA on a
                        multi-primary basis. </p>

                    <subtitle>SERVICE SITES OF AN LHS</subtitle>
                    <p>Handle System service components are scalable and extensible to accommodate
                        any large amount of service load. An LHS may consist of multiple service
                        sites, each hosting a full replica of the Handles managed by the service. A
                        site may be a primary site (it means that it can be used for administrative
                        operations: to create, modify or delete Handle Records stored in its
                        database) or a mirror site (no administrative operation is possible). Each
                        service site may also consist of a cluster of computers working together,
                        each with a particular subset of the Handles managed by the service. Having
                        multiple service sites avoids any single point of failure and allows load
                        balancing among these service sites. Using multiple servers at any service

                <p>To be able to use the core resolution service of the DOI System, a DOI resolver
                    is required. A DOI resolver is a client of the Handle System. </p>

                    <p>An earlier proxy address (https://dx.doi.org) is deprecated and its
                        use is discouraged.</p>
                    <p>With the HTTPS Proxy Server of the DOI System (https://doi.org) , users can
                        resolve DOI names from any standard web browser by using the URL syntax. For
                        example, the resolution of the DOI name "10.10.123/456" would be done from
                        the address https://doi.org/10.123/456.</p>
                    <p content-type="note">To enable the use of DOI names in workflows that have
                        already standardized on URNs, the DOI proxy servers understand the
                        substitution of a colon in place of the initial slash in a DOI name. DOI
                        names may therefore be expressed as URNs in the doi.org domain by writing,
                        for example, the DOI name 10.123/456 in the form
                        https://doi.org/urn:doi:10.123:456. However, a DOI suffix is allowed to
                        contain other slashes, and where these occur they must be hex-encoded rather
                        than replaced with a colon: for example, the DOI name 10.123/456ABC/zyz
                        would become https://doi.org/urn:doi:10.123:456ABC%2Fzyz, with the final

                    <list list-type="numbered">
                        <list-item>The DOI Proxy receives an HTTPS or HTTP request from a requester
                            for resolving a DOI name. The request is in the format
                            https://doi.org/&lt;doi-name&gt;?&lt;parameters&gt;. For more

                            LHS. Before sending the resolution request, the DOI Proxy decodes the
                            percent-encoded DOI name if necessary (see Error! Reference source not
                            found.).</list-item>

                                <list-item>If the DOI record contains a 10320/LOC element then the

                                    resulting URL in an HTTP(S) redirect, and sends it back to the
                                    requester (see 5.4.2).</list-item>
                                <list-item>Otherwise, the DOI Proxy redirects the requester to the

                    <p content-type="note">To speed resolution, the proxy servers cache DOI record
                        values, with the TTL (Time To Live) set to one hour. This means that if a
                        DOI record value is changed, it can take up to one hour before the new value
                        is returned. This setting is specific to the current proxy system and
                        different DOI software clients could be configured to behave differently.
                        The default Handle Record TTL setting is 24 hours, which is a common TTL
                        for Internet applications. While the one hour setting currently holds for
                        the DOI proxy, it would be best to design various DOI workflows assuming
                        the more conservative 24 hour period.</p>

                    <p>The DOI technical support service provider and the DOI Foundation are
                        committed to maintaining the DOI Proxy in perpetuity, as it is an essential
                        component to maintaining the integrity of the millions of instances of DOI
                        name-based web links. Maintaining the utility of those links over time will
                        require maintaining both the core DOI System and the specific gateway
                        service, doi.org, that those links reference and so use to gain access to
                        the core DOI System. This, of course, is not at all unique and is just
                        another variation on the Internet theme of layering services on top of one
                        another. doi.org is itself dependent on the Domain Name System (DNS), which
                        is itself dependent on IP addressing and routing, etc. </p>

                        request (for example, the particular user making the request) can be
                        included in the DOI resolution request sent to the DOI Proxy. Different
                        context expressed in the request may result in different resolution results.
                        Changes in context are predictable, and do not require the original creator
                        of the hyperlink to handcraft different URLs for different contexts.</p>
                    <p>Two URLs are involved in the parameter passing feature:</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The DOI Proxy combines the referrer URL with the referent URL to create the

                    <p>With urlappend, key-value pairs can be passed to the out-bound link by
                        placing them in the referrer URL as follows:</p>
                    <p>https://doi.org/&lt;doi-name&gt;?urlappend=%3F&lt;key1&gt;=&lt;value1&gt;%26&lt;key2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;...</p>
                    <p>The question mark (%3F) or the ampersand (%26) must be used before each
                        key-value pair.</p>
                    <p>For example, the referrer URL
                        https://doi.org/10.1256/003590?urlappend=%3Fparam1=12345%26param2=6789 is
                        combined with the referent URL https://www.publisher.org/resource9876 to
                        create the out-bound link
                        https://www.publisher.org/resource9876?param1=12345%26param2=6789 </p>
                    <p>If the referent URL already contains parameters then they may conflict with
                        the urlappend values. In the above example, the urlappend should start with
                        an ampersand character rather than a question mark character.</p>

                    <p>Content negotiation refers to mechanisms defined as a part of HTTP(S) that
                        make it possible to serve different representations of a resource at the
                        same URL, so that the content rendering software can specify which version
                        fits their capabilities the best. In the context of the DOI System, content
                        negotiation allows making a request that favors content types specific to a
                        particular Registration Agency (RA) but which will also degrade to respond
                        with a more standard content type for other RAs. </p>
                    <p>A content negotiated request to a DOI resolver is much like a standard
                        HTTP(S) request, except server-driven negotiation will take place based on
                        the list of acceptable content types a client provides. The request is done
                        by using an HTTPS header "Accept" where the GET includes several content
                        types that are acceptable to the requesting client process (those that it
                        knows how to parse), each content type with a specific preference level
                        (quality factor). </p>
                    <p>For example, Crossref RA uses content negotiation to redirect all requests
                        which are not for the content type "text/html" to the metadata service
                        managing the requested DOI name. To do so, the 10320/LOC element (which
                        corresponds to the content type "application/rdf+xml") is used in the DOI
                        record to specify the redi-rection to the respective metadata service. If
                        the DOI resolver does not support this content type then it will redirect to
                        the URL defined in the URL element (content type "text/html"). This is
                        illustrated in the DOI name example below. </p>

                        if CSL-JSON is unavailable. A preference level ("q" factor) is used in the

                    anyone, that creates shortcuts to DOI names which are often very long strings.
                    The shortDOI service provides a function similar to that which URL shortening
                    services do for URLs. The service creates short DOI names of the form 10/abcde
                    and enables short HTTPS URIs of the form https://doi.org/abcde that are ideal
                    for use in email, blogs, mobile messaging and more. (Note that shortDOIs are not
                    themselves DOI names and therefore do not conform to the ISO standard syntax and
                    other requirements. A shortDOI can only be created for an existing DOI name.) </p>
                <p>The shortDOI service proxy server only resolves the shortcuts, identically to the
                    way the DOI Proxy only resolves full DOI names. The service will either create a
                    new shortcut, or return the existing shortcut if one has already been
                    created.</p>
                <p>For automated purposes, the shortDOI service can also be used by simply
                    appending the original DOI name to the URL for the service. A format parameter
                    can be used to specify how information is to be returned. For further

            <p>This chapter discusses some of the ways in which resolution can be harnessed to
                provide applications with the ability to resolve a DOI name to the most appropriate
                content chosen from multiple DOI resolution options. These options can include
                pop-up menus offering manual selection, and consistent automated selection through
                content negotiation and Linked Data.</p>
            <section id="sec6.1">
                <title>Introduction to DOI Applications</title>
                <p>In order to maintain a persistent identifier, an active management service in
                    collaboration with registrants is required. To justify that management service,
                    a DOI application normally provides more value than simply registering a DOI —
                    typically a Registration Agency offers an added value service, such as citation
                    linking or metadata management. </p>
                <p>DOI names can identify many types of referent, and may resolve to more than just
                    a permanent, indirect link to that referent (or a proxy for the referent). They
                    can also provide or point to any useful information about the object when that
                    information has been provided by the registrant or a third party. This
                    information can include any type of descriptive metadata and any type of service
                    related to the object, such as rights clearance, alerting services, data
                    visualization or any other associated information or service. The information
                    can be used in many ways by DOI applications customized to meet users' needs. </p>
                <p content-type="note">No ability to search from metadata to DOI name (reverse
                    look-up) is provided by the DOI System. It may be offered by Registration
                    Agencies or other services as a value-added feature. A variety of technologies
                    are in use for this purpose among the RAs, including the <ext-link
                        xlink:href="https://www.cordra.org/">Cordra</ext-link> registry system as
                    well as custom applications.</p>

            <section id="sec6.2">
                <title>Use and Extension of the Resolution Functions</title>
                <p>At the most basic level, all DOI applications query the DOI System by resolving a
                    DOI name. The request can be structured to ask for all of the DOI record
                    elements associated with that DOI name, or all of the elements of a specific
                    type and/or index, etc. (see DOI Proxy Query Command Format). Applications are
                    built to understand one or more of the element types, and parse, evaluate, and
                    take action based on the corresponding element values.</p>
                <p>The DOI record that is associated with a DOI name is stored in the DOI System in
                    type/value pairs (see 5.1.2). This is extremely flexible and open: new types can
                    be added at any time, and the values can be of arbitrary complexity. Type/value
                    pairs can be administrative (creation date, permissions, etc.), well known and
                    standardized (URL, email, 10320/LOC, etc.), or created by a Registration Agency
                    for a specific application purpose (for example, a custom type with a value that
                    is binary data or a specially formatted string). There can be many type/value
                    pairs associated with a DOI name, and multiples of the same type.</p>
                <p>Associating XML, or other machine readable data with a DOI name, expands the
                    utility of multiple resolution even further, adding features, and offering more
                    options for negotiating content, and facilitating the creation of Linked Data
                    applications.</p>
                <p content-type="note">New types should, but are not required to, be registered in
                    the Handle System as Handles. As a general rule types containing a slash (for
                    example, 10320/LOC) should be considered full Handles and those without a slash
                    (for example, URL) should be assumed to be suffixes under the 0.TYPE prefix
                    (with the previous example: 0.TYPE/URL). The type Handle Record may define the
                    syntax, structure, possible semantics, or any other necessary descriptive
                    characteristics of the corresponding value field. For more information, see the

                    <p>Multiple resolution with 10320/LOC element (see 5.4.2) is useful for building
                        applications where the required evaluation is to choose from a set of
                        possible outcomes based on some criteria. An application developer could
                        create a type in which to store values used by a client to generate a menu
                        of options for a user when the user resolves a DOI name. In the case of a
                        document, the user might be given the option to view the document, view
                        document metadata, share the document by emailing the URL to an associate,
                        visit the author's blog, etc. For a dataset, the choices offered to the user
                        on the landing page may include viewing the complete dataset, viewing only
                        selected data, or some other choice of interaction with the dataset based on
                        the information made available to a client via resolution of the DOI
                        name.</p>
                    <p>For example, scholarly journal articles are assigned one DOI name, but they
                        can be available from multiple web sites, and readers may wish to download
                        an article from a service to which they are subscribed. Crossref uses
                        multiple resolution to enable users to resolve an article's DOI name, and
                        choose which version of an article they wish to view, as illustrated below. </p>

                    <p>Multiple resolution with 10320/LOC element (see 5.4.2) can be used to enable
                        a DOI resolver to choose what the outcome of resolving a DOI name will be
                        for a specific user, based on a given criteria. The figure below shows
                        (non-administrative) elements associated with DOI name
                        10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.9. When this DOI name was registered it had a single
                        URL element (type of URL and value, aka data, equal to a JSTOR URL). A
                        10320/LOC type was added to provide instructions for offering other
                        resolution options (see 10.4.1 for information about the XML attributes used
                        in 10320/LOC element). When this record is returned to the DOI Proxy, it
                        recognizes the 10320/LOC type and, if asked to do so, performs an evaluation
                        of the location values based on a given criteria.</p>

                <title>Redirection to Linked Data Servies</title>
                <p>Linked Data is the general term for a set of best practices for exposing data in
                    machine-readable form using the content-negotiation feature of the standard
                    HTTP(S) web protocol. These best practices support the development of tools to
                    link and make use of data from multiple web sources without the need to deal
                    with many different proprietary and incompatible application programming
                    interfaces (APIs), and use of HTTP(S) to request data in structured form meant
                    for machines instead of human-readable displays.</p>
                <p>In Linked Data applications, evaluation of the HTTP(S) request that comes in to
                    the proxy service determines if it is a request for content of form
                    application/rdf+xml, or one of a few similar types that are commonly understood
                    to be a request for Linked Data. These requests for special content types would
                    come from automated processes or special "linked data" browsers and would not
                    normally come from end users. The utility of this, of course, is that it allows
                    outside developers to query the extensive and reliable set of metadata records
                    held by Registration Agencies (RA) to build value-added services.</p>
                <p>Some RAs are using this approach for all of their DOI names, offering services
                    that return metadata in a common machine-readable format. A significant
                    advantage of applying Linked Data principles and technologies to DOI-registered
                    material is that it is "data worth linking to": it is curated, value-added,
                    data, which is managed, corrected, updated and consistently maintained by RAs.
                    It is also persistent, so avoiding "bit-rot". In practice, the quality of Linked
                    data implementations is only as good as the data you are linking to, and the
                    meaning and contextualization of the link you use. The DOI System can offer
                    "curated data", it means consistent, managed, linking so you can link to other
                    "quality data" with confidence, while still using the standard Linked Data
                    technologies.</p>
                <p>The following figure shows a redirection to the metadata service managing the DOI
                    name. The 10320/LOC element information can be stored at prefix level (see
                    10.4.3): should an RA at some point need to change their approach to linked data
                    and point to a different service or use different parameters, the change could
                    be made to a single DOI prefix and it would apply to all of the millions of DOI
                    names automatically. </p>

                <title>Dynamic Identification of the Fragments of an Entity</title>
                <p>In some cases, applications may require the identification of fragments of an
                    entity, rather than the full entity. Each such fragment may be assigned a
                    separate DOI name if it is practical and useful to do so (for example, if a
                    specific table within a book is likely to be reused many times). However, this
                    may not always be possible: there are also cases where one wishes to identify in
                    principle any fragment of this entity as it becomes needed on the fly. For such
                    cases, use may be made of Template Handles (see section 11 in the <ext-link
                        xlink:href="http://www.handle.net/tech_manual/HN_Tech_Manual_9.pdf"
                        >Handle.net Technical Manual</ext-link> ): a single template DOI Handle can
                    be included in the form of a base formula that allows any number of extensions
                    to that base to be resolved as full DOI Handles, according to a pattern, without
                    each such Handle being individually registered. This would allow, for example,
                    the use of DOI names to reference an unlimited number of ranges within a video
                    without each potential range having to be registered with a separate Handle. If
                    the pattern needs to be changed, for example, the video moves or a different
                    kind of server is used to deliver the video clips, only the single base DOI name
                    (Handle) needs to be changed to allow an unlimited number of previously
                    constructed extensions to continue to resolve properly.</p>

                                        role of Registration Agencies (RA). This deceptively easy

                                        often much more difficult than it might at first appear. The
                                        answer to when two things are "the same thing" is entirely
                                        contextual, it means what a specific application will need

                <title>Design Considerations</title>
                <p>Flexibility and scalability are important features of well-designed DOI-enabled
                    services. </p>
                <p>The most flexible and scalable approach is to use the DOI System as a lightweight
                    redirection mechanism, resolving identifiers to well-structured data. This
                    approach can be used to provide DOI-related services beyond that of a single
                    level of redirection. In addition to simply resolving a DOI name and getting
                    back a single URL, DOI registration agencies may offer multiple resolution
                    services, linking a DOI name to multiple options about the referent (for
                    example, bibliographic metadata), and those options may include requests for
                    particular representations of metadata, or metadata useable only for particular
                    contexts</p>
                <p>Developers may choose to put all or most of the information provided by the
                    service in the DOI System itself, such that the DOI system is the primary
                    service provider, or alternatively, use the DOI System to point to one or more
                    external services to provide the desired information and functions. For example,
                    the DOI System may be used to store all of the data required to display a simple
                    menu of labelled options for a user to pick from, but redirecting to an external
                    service that stores large quantities of scientific data for visualization tools,
                    or multiple image files, might be preferable to storing that data in the DOI
                    System.</p>
                <p>Developing applications that store, use, and share high-quality machine-readable
                    data in a standardized format is a further design consideration. DOI
                    applications can be designed to conform to the best practices of Linked Data, a
                    well-known concept of exposing data in machine-readable form, using the content
                    negotiation feature of the standard HTTP web protocol. </p>
                <p content-type="note">The use of HTTPS over HTTP is highly recommended.</p>
                <p>Creating services that take advantage of DOI structured data to create
                    consistency across RA applications is encouraged. Collaboration is encouraged
                    whenever possible. Third party application developers not part of the DOI
                    Foundation are also encouraged to be part of the process of creating services
                    that take advantage of DOI structured data.</p>
                <p>A sampling of DOI application services based on multiple resolution and content
                    negotiation are described in Chapter 6. New services may be created at any time.

                this policy to the Registration Agencies (see 2.3). The Registration Agencies
                enforce their own operational policies, specific to their community of interest.
                These specific <index-term ref="sec8">policies</index-term> will be consistent with the DOI Foundation's high-level
                policies.</p>

                <title>Defining a Prefix Allocation Policy</title>
                <p>As a Registration Agency (RA), you may choose to assign prefixes to your
                    customers (see 1.7.4). To do so, you should define a prefix allocation
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The DOI Foundation allots to each RA prefixes as a block of sequential numbers
                    that have no special meaning (prefixes are created by the DOI technical support
                    service provider). No reserved prefixes may be requested.</p>
                <p>Some RAs will manage all assignments themselves and can operate under a single
                    prefix. Others will want to delegate assignment to customers and in this case,
                    it is recommended that prefixes are assigned at an appropriate level to deal
                    with business requirements. Typically, a Registration Agency (RA) may issue one
                    prefix per customer, but it might also be appropriate to issue a prefix per
                    brand, or to some recognizable cluster of products (for example, a publisher
                    imprint). The choice is the RA's, but the DOI Foundation and/or other RAs can
                    discuss requirements and make recommendations.</p>
                <p content-type="note">In case DOI names must be transferred from one RA to another,
                    the foremost technical issue in this transfer is the one-to-one relation of
                    prefix to Local Handle Service (LHS). In this perspective, RAs should allocate
                    at least one separate prefix for each customer, and where appropriate more than
                    one, since the fundamental constraint is that all DOI names under a given prefix
                    must reside in the same LHS (this general architecture is a logical and
                    efficient approach to a distributed service and is far from unique to the Handle
                    System). </p>

                <p>The effective operation of the DOI System depends on accurate resolution of a DOI
                    name to the appropriate URL or other data type. To maintain quality services, it
                    is also crucial that metadata assigned to a DOI name be regularly updated.
                    Therefore, the maintenance of URLs and data about a DOI name should be subject
                    to a policy. In particular, the policy should specify who, between the
                    Registration Agency (RA), the registrant or a service organization acting with
                    the authority of the registrant, is responsible for the data maintenance.</p>

                    transferred from one registrant to another (both registrants being related to
                    the same Registration Agency (RA)), the DOI names within that compilation are
                    transferred as well. Each RA will develop appropriate procedures for proper
                    transfers. Transfers may be a sale, or any form of exchange, commercial or
                    otherwise. If the new owner is not already a registrant, special arrangements
                    may have to be made appropriate to the case. Consult the DOI Foundation for
                    guidance if necessary.</p>
                <p>The individual DOI names stay the same, it means that what the DOI name
                    identifies is not changed. This is a fundamental requirement. The DOI name
                    prefix does NOT change (recall that a prefix is not meaningful, but is initially
                    assigned to a registrant for convenience in generating DOI names only; no
                    reverse look-up can be inferred to a prefix). The administrative value is
                    changed in order for the new owner to modify its data elements (most likely the
                    URL element). Both registrants involved in the transfer need to send email to
                    the DOI technical support service provider at doi-admin@doi.org giving
                    permission for the transfer. The technical support service provider will assist

                                        <p>locatt: Only locations from an attribute passed in the
                                            Proxy/DOI name-URL link are selected.</p>
                                        <p>Example: With doi:10.123/456?locatt=id:1, the resolver
                                            will return the locations that have an "id" attribute of
                                            1. </p>
                                        <p>country: Only locations that have a country attribute
                                            matching the country of the requester are selected. If
                                            no matching locations are found then locations that have
                                            no country attribute are selected. </p>

                                        <p>weighted: A single location is selected based on the
                                            weight assigned to each location:</p>
                                        <p>A location with no weight attribute is assumed to have
                                            weight one. </p>
                                        <p>A higher weight is selected first.</p>
                                        <p>If several locations have the same weight then a random
                                            choice is performed.</p>
                                        <p>If the weighted selection method is applied to locations
                                            that all have non-positive weights, then this method
                                            selects one of the remaining locations randomly while
                                            disregarding location weights.</p>
                                        <p>Note: The weighting allows for a very basic load
                                            balancing, but is also a way to ensure that some
                                            locations can only be addressed directly (for example,
                                            by country or locatt/attributes).</p>

                    <p>Any location information (information specified through a 10320/LOC element)
                        that applies to all or most DOI names under a prefix can be stored at prefix
                        level: this information applies to all DOI names under that prefix. If
                        specific location information is stored at DOI name level then this
                        information overrides information stored at prefix level.</p>
                    <p>Location information is stored at prefix level by using the HS_NAMESPACE
                        element in the record of the prefix Handle (0.NA/&lt;prefix&gt;): the
                        HS_NAMESPACE element points to another Handle or DOI name which will store a
                        10320/LOC element. Typically, this element will contain URL templates. For
                        more information about the HS_NAMESPACE element, see the <ext-link

                <p>1) An administrator is identified in the Handle System by a public key stored in
                    a Handle Record (in this example, the public key is at index 200 of 0.NA/10.1009
                    record). User authentication is performed by a Handle System service through a
                    PKI challenge-response.</p>
